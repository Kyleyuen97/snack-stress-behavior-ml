### Snack Consumption and Stress Behavior - ML Project

In the original experiment I administered studies at NYU Stern's Center for Behavioral Research, tracking the consumption rate of snacks relative to stress simulated by computer tests.

Students were informed that better performance on the test would marginally increase participation scores, to draw their focus to scoring well, and remove the Hawthorne Effect* on the actual item being measured - snack consumption rate.

As this dataset is not available for public consumption, I utilized a similar Dataset on more recent Data by the NIH regarding COVID-19 pandemic psychological stress and emotional eating and performed my modelling work on their dataset.

#### Data Overview

- **Subjects**: The test subjects.
- **mYFAS 2.0**: The Modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (Schulte & Gearhardt, 2017).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index.
- **CSM score**: Coronavirus Stress Measure (CSM) (Arslan et al., 2021).
- **Negative Emotional Eating**: Calculated from the Emotional Eating Questionnaire (EMAQ) (Geliebter & Aversa, 2003).
- **Positive Emotional Eating**: Calculated from the Emotional Eating Questionnaire (EMAQ) (Geliebter & Aversa, 2003).
- **Simplified Food Diversity Questionnaire**: Based on the Nova classification system (Monteiro et al., 2016) and evaluates the consumption of unprocessed foods.
- **Nova Score for the Consumption of UPFs**: The Nova Score (Costa et al., 2021) is based on the Nova classification system (Monteiro et al., 2016) and evaluates the consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs).

### Key Concepts

- **Hawthorne Effect** (also known as the "Observer Effect"): Testers may alter their original or candid behavior if they know they are being watched. In this experiment, students were informed that their performance would increase their participation score to minimize this effect.
