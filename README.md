Snack Consumption and Stress Behavior - ML Project
Previous Data Collected on NYU students, tracking consumption rate of snacks relative to stress simulated by computer tests.
Students were informed that better performance on the test would marginally increase participation scores, to draw their focus to scoring well, and remove the Hawthorne Effect* on the actual item being measured - snack consumption rate.

As this dataset is not publically available, I utilized a similar Dataset on more recent Data by the NIH and performed similar hierarchical clustering on their dataset.

Column Explanations:

SUBJECT	- the test subject
mYFAS 2.0	- The Modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS 2.0) (Schulte & Gearhardt, 2017) 
BMI	- Body Mass Index
CSM score	- Coronavirus Stress Measure (CSM) (Arslan et al., 2021).
Negative emotional eating	- calculated from Emotional Eating Questionnaire (EMAQ) (Geliebter & Aversa, 2003).
Positive Emotional Eating	- calculated from Emotional Eating Questionnaire (EMAQ) (Geliebter & Aversa, 2003).
Simplified food diversity questionnaire(Sattamini, 2019) - based on the Nova classification system (Monteiro et al., 2016) and aims to evaluate the consumption of unprocessed foods
Nova Score for the consumption of UPFs - The Nova Score (Costa et al., 2021) is based on the Nova classification system (Monteiro et al., 2016) and aims to evaluate the consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs). 


*Also known as the "Observer Effect" -  testers may alter their original or candid behavior if they know they're being watched.
