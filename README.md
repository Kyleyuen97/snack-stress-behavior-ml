### Snack Consumption and Stress Behavior - ML Project

The original experiment conducted studies involving NYU students, tracking the consumption rate of snacks relative to stress simulated by computer tests.

#### Data Overview

- **Subjects**: The test subjects.
- **mYFAS 2.0**: The Modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (Schulte & Gearhardt, 2017).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index.
- **CSM score**: Coronavirus Stress Measure (CSM) (Arslan et al., 2021).
- **Negative Emotional Eating**: Calculated from the Emotional Eating Questionnaire (EMAQ) (Geliebter & Aversa, 2003).
- **Positive Emotional Eating**: Calculated from the Emotional Eating Questionnaire (EMAQ) (Geliebter & Aversa, 2003).
- **Simplified Food Diversity Questionnaire**: Based on the Nova classification system (Monteiro et al., 2016) and evaluates the consumption of unprocessed foods.
- **Nova Score for the Consumption of UPFs**: The Nova Score (Costa et al., 2021) is based on the Nova classification system (Monteiro et al., 2016) and evaluates the consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs).

### Key Concepts

- **Hawthorne Effect** (also known as the "Observer Effect"): Testers may alter their original or candid behavior if they know they are being watched. In this experiment, students were informed that their performance would increase their participation score to minimize this effect.

### Hierarchical Clustering

- You performed hierarchical clustering on the NIH dataset to examine how these variables relate to snack consumption behavior in stressed individuals.
